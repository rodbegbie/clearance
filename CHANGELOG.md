# Clearance Changelog

## 1.3.0 - March 21, 2026

- Migrated Clearance to the `com.primeradiant.Clearance` app identity, and now import existing settings and History from older `com.jesse.Clearance` installs on first launch so the transition stays clean.
- Replaced the app-bundled CLI symlink install with a bundled `ClearanceCLIInstaller.pkg` that installs a standalone `clearance` command-line tool into `/usr/local/bin`, so the CLI keeps working even if the app moves. Thanks to Rod Begbie for the original CLI request in `#16` and the follow-up bug reports in `#25` and `#26`.
- Added a one-time migration installer package to the release pipeline so this version can replace older `/Applications/Clearance.app` installs cleanly during the bundle-ID transition.
- Fixed rendered document View mode so the diagram overlay stays hidden until it is opened, instead of leaking a lone `Close` button into the page. Thanks to `earchibald` for the bug report in `#23`.

## 1.2.7 - March 20, 2026

- Fixed rendered image loading for markdown documents by restoring correct resource resolution for sibling files while preserving in-document heading links. Thanks to Christian Metts for the bug report in `#22`.

## 1.2.6 - March 19, 2026

- Added `File > New…` with the standard `Cmd-N` shortcut, so Clearance can create a new markdown file from a save panel and open it directly in Edit mode. Thanks to lekashman for the request in `#13`.
- Added a bundled `clearance` command-line tool plus a best-effort installer in Settings that symlinks it into `/usr/local/bin`. The helper opens files and folders in Clearance, and creates missing markdown files before opening them. Thanks to Rod Begbie for the request in `#16`.
- Fixed heading rendering so inline code spans remain inline code inside headings instead of being flattened to plain text. Thanks to Peter Seibel for the fix in `#17`.
- Added click-to-expand overlays for rendered Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams so larger diagrams can be inspected without leaving the document flow. Thanks to Dinh Nguyen for the feature request in `#20`.

## 1.2.4 - March 19, 2026

- Fixed printing and Print to PDF so rendered markdown always uses a print-safe light palette instead of disappearing on white paper. Thanks to Harper Reed for the bug report in `#21`.
- Dim unavailable local files in History and disable open-only actions for them while still allowing removal. Thanks to Peter Seibel for surfacing the missing-file cleanup problem in `#15`.
- Adopted Rod Begbie's simpler app icon artwork from `#19` while keeping Clearance's existing generated `AppIcon.appiconset` pipeline.

## 1.2.3 - March 13, 2026

- Fixed in-document GFM anchor links so links like `#the-anchor-tag` scroll within the current file instead of opening the containing folder in Finder.
- Improved table rendering by allowing markdown tables to size columns naturally while preserving the metadata table layout.

## 1.2.2 - March 10, 2026

- Improved checklist indentation so task list checkboxes align more naturally with their text.
- `Open…` can now accept a folder, adding supported markdown and text files to History in most-recently-modified order, with confirmation before importing more than 10 files at once.

## 1.2.1 - March 9, 2026

- Fixed external file-open events so opening a markdown file into an already-running Clearance window reuses that window instead of spawning duplicates.

## 1.2.0 - March 9, 2026

- Added native file dragging from the address bar document icon, so the open local file can be dropped directly into Finder, Slack, and other apps that accept file URLs.
- Fixed recent-files sidebar drags to use real file URLs for external drops while preserving Clearance's internal pop-out drag behavior.

## 1.1.0 - March 7, 2026

- Added bundled Graphviz DOT rendering for fenced `dot` and `graphviz` blocks, and now scale diagrams and markdown images to fit the reading column instead of sliding under the outline.
- Improved markdown rendering for structured guidance docs by treating embedded HTML/XML-like tags as literal text and correctly rendering fenced code blocks inside custom wrapper tags like `<Good>` and `<Bad>`.
- Tightened remote document loading so only explicit `http://` and `https://` URLs open remotely, while remote fetches now reject HTML and other unsupported content types instead of rendering them as markdown.
- Refined the address bar to behave more like a document field, including full-path editing for local files, safer URL parsing, and standard reopen behavior that reuses the existing window instead of opening duplicates.
- Local files now auto-refresh when they change on disk in View mode, while Edit mode still protects in-progress work by prompting before replacing unsaved content.

## 1.0.4 - March 6, 2026

- Added rendered document text zoom controls with standard macOS `Actual Size`, `Zoom In`, and `Zoom Out` menu commands, while preserving scroll position as the rendered view resizes.
- Refined rendered markdown typography and styling for a cleaner reading experience across built-in themes.
- Added bundled in-app release notes, which now open automatically on first launch after an update and remain available later from the app menu.
- Improved the recent history sidebar so entries can be removed directly and sidebar animations respect the system `Reduce Motion` setting.

## 1.0.3 - March 6, 2026

- Added secure remote markdown opening, rendering, navigation, and history handling alongside local documents.
- Introduced a smarter address bar that shows concise filenames or URLs in display mode, expands to full paths or URLs while editing, and now stays visible without pushing critical toolbar controls off-screen.
- Updated the outline sidebar to collapse and expand with native split-view behavior, including smoother animation in both the main workspace and pop-out windows.

## 1.0.2 - March 5, 2026

- Fixed internal markdown heading links so in-document anchor navigation reliably scrolls to the target heading.
- Switched markdown rendering to GFM-compatible parsing for tables, task lists, and strikethrough support.
- Added richer markdown rendering coverage and demo corpus validation for tables, math/LaTeX, and Mermaid content.
- Fixed task list layout so checkboxes render without duplicate bullet markers and with correct spacing/alignment.
